## My process

### Built with

- HTML: You'll need to know how to structure your web page using HTML elements and attributes. This includes creating containers, adding images, and adding text elements.
- CSS: CSS is essential for styling your QR code component and making it visually appealing. You should be familiar with CSS properties, selectors, and layout techniques like flexbox or grid.

### What I learned

Here are some of the major learnings from working on this project, along with code samples to highlight these areas:

1. Creating a Responsive Layout with Flexbox:

One major learning was how to use flexbox to create a responsive layout for the QR code component. Here's an example of how flexbox can be used to center the container vertically and horizontally:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

2. Styling Elements with CSS:

I learned various CSS techniques to style the different elements of the QR code component. Here's an example of how to apply rounded corners to the container and the QR code image:

```css
.container {
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.qr-code img {
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```

3. Importing and Using Custom Fonts:

I discovered how to import and use custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the component. Here's an example of importing the Outfit font from Google Fonts and applying it to the title and subtitle:

```css
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap");

.title,
.subtitle {
  font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

1. Dynamic QR Code Generation with JavaScript: We can use JavaScript to dynamically generate the QR code. This involved using a library or API that can generate QR codes and manipulating the DOM to display the generated code.

```javascript
// Generate QR code using a library or API
const qrCodeData = generateQRCodeData();

// Display the generated QR code in the component
const qrCodeElement = document.createElement("img");
qrCodeElement.src = qrCodeData;
document.querySelector(".qr-code").appendChild(qrCodeElement);
```

2. Error Handling: Implement error handling for scenarios where the QR code generation fails or there are issues with the data input. You can display appropriate error messages to the user and provide guidance on how to resolve the issue.

3. Customization Options: Allow users to customize the appearance of the QR code, such as changing the colors, adding a logo overlay, or adjusting the size. This can provide a more personalized experience for users.

4. QR Code Scanning: Integrate QR code scanning functionality so that users can scan QR codes using their device's camera. This can be achieved using a JavaScript library like QuaggaJS or by utilizing browser APIs such as the WebRTC API.

5. Dynamic Data Input: Enable users to input dynamic data for generating the QR code, such as text inputs, URLs, or contact information. You can provide form fields and validate the input before generating the QR code.

6. Mobile Optimization: Optimize the project for mobile devices to ensure that the QR code generator works well on smaller screens and touch interfaces. Consider using responsive design techniques and mobile-friendly interactions.

7. Localization: Implement support for multiple languages so that users from different regions can use the QR code generator in their native language. This involves creating language files, handling translations, and providing language selection options.

8. QR Code Analytics: Track and analyze QR code usage by integrating analytics tools. This can provide insights into the number of scans, user engagement, and other metrics that can help evaluate the effectiveness of the QR codes.

Remember, these are just a few ideas to continue developing the project. The direction you choose will depend on your goals, target audience, and the specific functionalities you want to add.
